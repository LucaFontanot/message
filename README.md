# message

Message is the first cross-server proxy messaging platform for Velocity with API and LuckPerms integration.

It is simple yet extensive, allowing for a working messaging system with no setup, but is also completely customisable
with logical configuration files and API.

It has:

* **full & custom translation support** - all messages sent by the plugin can be customised, which is useful for
  networks that have struggled with english-only plugins for years
* **extensive customisation** - every aspect of the plugin can be customised
* **LuckPerms integration** - if one wants to customise messages using data from LuckPerms, that is completely
  achievable with message
* **API integration** - other plugins can integrate with message, for example moderation plugins or your internal
  toolkit for the best user & moderation experiences
